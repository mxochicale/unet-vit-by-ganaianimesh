# SBVPI (Sclera Blood Vessels, Periocular and Iris) 

"SBVPI is a publicly available dataset designated primarily for research into sclera recognition, but it is also suitable for experiments with iris and periocular recognition techniques. It consists of 1858 high-resolution RGB images of eyes from 55 subjects. Images of the dataset were captured during a single recording session with a digital single-lens reflex camera (DSLR) (Canon EOS 60D) at the highest resolution and quality setting. Macro lenses were used to ensure sufficiently high-quality and visibility of fine details in the captured images. This procedure resulted in images with clearly visible scleral vasculature patterns, as shown in Figure 1." https://sclera.fri.uni-lj.si/datasets.html
